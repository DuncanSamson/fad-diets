    <h2 class="text-xl py-4">What Is It?</h3>
    <p class="text-lg">A bright orange artificial dye made from petroleum, used to give foods and drinks a strong orange colour.</p>
    <h2 class="text-xl pt-8 pb-2 font-bold">How Is It Made?</h3>
    <p class="text-lg"> It's created in a lab using chemicals from petrol.
        Aromatic hydrocarbons are extracted from the petrol as starting materials for colour production.
        Sulfonic acid groups are added to make it water-soluble.
        Itâ€™s then purified using filtration and crystallisation.
        The purified dye is then concentrated by evaporation
        It then changes into a thick liquid ready to be dried.
        Finally, it's dried into a powder or granules.
        Packaged and ready to be added to many of our foods.</p>
    <h2 class="text-xl pt-8 pb-2 font-bold">What Effects Could It Have On YOur Brain?</h3>
    <p class="text-lg">Some studies suggest that E110, especially when combined with certain preservatives, may increase hyperactivity
        in children. This includes difficulty concentrating and increased restlessness.
        WHAT EFFECTS COULD IT HAVE ON YOUR BODY?
        E110 can cause allergic reactions in some people, particularly those sensitive to aspirin. It can cause skin
        rashes, a sore stomach, or difficulty breathing. </p>
    <h2 class="text-xl pt-8 pb-2 font-bold">Fun Facts</h3>
    <p class="text-lg">In the EU, products containing E110 must carry a warning label: "May have an adverse effect on activity and
        attention in children."
        E110 is banned in some countries, like Norway and Finland, but still allowed in the UK.
        It's commonly found in sweets, soft drinks, and snack foods.</p>
