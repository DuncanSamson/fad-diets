                  I am the lead Game developer behind our game's functionality, bringing its mechanics to life,
                  and the artistic genius responsible for the sprite artwork that gives it its unique visual charm."></x-member>

                  individualBlurb="Hey! I’m Howie The Clown — official intern, snack hoarder, and the reason this site nearly missed every deadline. I was supposed to do research, but I mostly just used ChatGPT prompts like 'what is food' and spent three hours arguing with a toaster. I didn’t really write anything useful, but I did suggest we use more glitter (they said no). So if you find something helpful on this site, it definitely wasn’t me. But if you find a typo or a weird fact about cheese... yeah, that one’s mine. You’re welcome."></x-member>
