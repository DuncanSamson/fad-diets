    <h2 class="text-xl pt-8 pb-2 font-bold">How Is It Made?</h2>
    <p class="text-lg">Palm fruits are harvested and then steamed
        They are then pressed to remove the crude oil
        The oil is then clarified to remove impurities
        It is then fractionated by cooling
        This process separates the solid (palm fat) from the liquid fraction
        Chemical or physical refining may follow
        The fat is then filtered and dried
        Finally, it’s packaged for use in food products </p>
    <h2 class="text-xl pt-8 pb-2 font-bold">What Affects Could It Have On Your Brain?</h2>
    <p class="text-lg">Research on high-saturated fat diets indicates that diets rich in palm fat may alter brain function, potentially
        affecting memory and learning.
        <h2>What Affects Could It Have On Your Body?</h2>
        Some studies suggest that a high intake of palm fat can contribute to weight gain and may increase cholesterol
        levels, posing a risk to heart health over time.</p>
    <h2 class="text-xl pt-8 pb-2 font-bold">Fun Facts</h2>
