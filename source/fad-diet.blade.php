                <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                    This diet focuses on eating primarily animal products such as meat, eggs, and dairy, while also including fruit and honey, with extra focus on avoiding seed oils and vegetables particularl those high in Oxalates (A vegetable’s defence chemical).

                <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                    This diet excludes all plant-based foods, relying exclusively on animal products, such as meat, fish, eggs, and dairy to provide all the nutrients the body and mind requires. There are variations to the diet with some users eliminating the dairy element from the diet.

                <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                    The Lion Diet includes only three things: ruminant meat, salt, and water. No spices, oils, or caffeine.
                    It’s often followed for 30–90 days before slowly reintroducing foods to test reactions.
                    Mikhaila Peterson has documented her journey online, helping thousands try it for themselves.
                    Mikhaila named the diet the Lion diet as it most reflected the diet of Lions who eat mostly ruminant meat.
